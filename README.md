# Instrument-control
The repository contains various MATLAB objects made for controlling instruments. The superclass `MyInstrument` has some basic functionality the subclasses can use. The MyTrace object is made for simple loading, saving and plotting of data and passing the data around with associated units and tags.
## MyFit Dependencies
MyFit needs the MATLAB GUI Layout Toolbox (https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox) and the `UICOMPONENT` toolbox (http://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14583-uicomponent-expands-uicontrol-to-all-java-classes) for its GUI.
